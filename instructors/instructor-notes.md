## Exploring the dataset

During a live workshop, skip this page. Use the introductory ppt slide to explain where the data comes from.

## Processing data with DIA-NN

During a live workshop, present this content lecture-style for participants to follow along.

Open an instance of DIA-NN on your device for demonstration purposes.

## Data cleaning with R

During a live workshop, ask participants to open a new R script to run the code themselves.

Can present the content as an interactive tutorial, or ask participants to work through the lesson independently with pauses to discuss.

## Differential expression analysis

During a live workshop, participants should work through the lesson content independently, with pauses for discussion before and after the visualisation component.

### Heatmap interpretation

As expected, our samples cluster into their respective classes. 

The three proteins with decreased expression in the aCD samples are clearly distinguishable from those with increased expression in the aCD samples.

There are no apparent batch effects confounding these results.

## Network and Enrichment Analysis

During a live workshop, participants should work through the lesson content independently, with pauses for discussion after each component.
